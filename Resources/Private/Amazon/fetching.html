    Chuckit's Flying Squirrel toy is an aerodynamic, visually exciting alternative to the traditional frisbee. This Chuckit! frisbee for dogs features four, bright orange "paws" that are eye-catching during the day and glow in the dark at night. By flinging the Flying Squirrel by the "paw," pet parents can send the toy soaring and engage pets in a thrilling game of fetch. These tough dog toys are made of a durable canvas material to withstand rugged play, while its soft, curved sides are gently on dogs' mouths. Ideal for water-loving dogs, the Chuckit! Flying Squirrel doubles as a dog float toy for fetch at the lake or the beach. With a brightly colored design, pets and pet parents will never lose sight of the Flying Squirrel on land or water. Dogs large and small can enjoy fetch with the Chuckit!
